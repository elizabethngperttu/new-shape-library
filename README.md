# The New Shape Library (Alpha version)

This is where all the entries that made it to semi-finals in the New Shape Prize are being iterated on. You can find them in the folder above called `global governance models`.

## How To Suggest Changes
1. Navigate to the entry in the `global governance models` folder.
2. Press the button that looks like a pen in the top right corner (you will get a tooltip `Edit this file`).
3. Make your desired changes to the entry. The file is in the format Markdown, if you're unfamiliar please see [this guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
4. Scroll down to the bottom of the page to the text `Propose file change`
5. Add a short descriptive title to your changes in the small input box. Example `Remove HTML code`
6. Add a short descriptive text describing the essence of what you're suggesting be changed. Example: `Some HTML code was not converted to Markdown, removing some of it with these proposed changed.`
7. Press the button `Propose file change`. This will take you to a new screen with the title `Open a pull request`.
8. Press the button `Create pull request`.
9. You will be taken to a new view called a `Pull Request` where your changes will be viewable to everyone. We will then review the changes and reply in to you in that view. Keep track of your Github or email notifications.

It is only after the 8th step that your changes are saved as proposed changes. In technical terms the changes are saved in a commit which is pushed to a remote branch and then presented as a `Pull Request`.
